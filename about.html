                <h1>about me.</h1>
                <br>
                <p>I was born in France but grew up in between Paris and Santo Domingo. My family of travellers gave me the chance to visit a lot of places, at all ages meeting many people from various background. This international childhood helped me shape a broad vision of the world we are living in. Always curious, I initially developed an appeal for design through cars — specifically Formula 1 — their aerodynamic design that allows them to stay on the track at high speed has always fascinated me. Meanwhile I grew with the iPhone (my first phone was the iPhone), Facebook, YouTube, which has lead me to have a keen interest in digital products and user experience. So I decided to study business at the most international business school I could apply to in Paris in order to work in this field in the future. Right after my graduation I decided to build my first product with a tech co-founder (from Ecole42) that I met on the fly. Our objective was to build the next social platform dedicated to the electronic music community to connect & discover events. I am now looking to thrive within an agile product team working on a consumer product and learn alongside inspiring people in the industry.</p>
